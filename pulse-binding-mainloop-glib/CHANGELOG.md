# 2.29.0 (March 3rd, 2025)

 * Bumped MSRV from 1.56 to 1.63 per dependencies.
 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.28 to 2.29.
    - `libpulse-mainloop-glib-sys` from 1.21 to 1.22.

# 2.28.1 (July 18th, 2023)

 * Fixed cross-crate version requirements.

# 2.28.0 (July 18th, 2023)

 * Fixed docs.rs build failure.
 * Dropped PA v4 support.

# 2.27.1 (January 9th, 2023)

 * Fixed broken build status badge in readme.

# 2.27.0 (January 9th, 2023)

 * Bumped Rust edition to 2021.
 * Added `rust-version` (MSRV) attribute to `cargo.toml` file.
 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.24 to 2.27.
    - `libpulse-mainloop-glib-sys` from 1.19 to 1.20.

Note: version 2.26 skipped to catch up with main `libpulse-binding` version.

# 2.25.1 (January 13th, 2022)

 * Minor tweaks not worth documenting.

# 2.25.0 (August 29th, 2021)

 * Minor tweaks to work with the changes in verson 2.25.0 of the main binding crate.
 * Minor formatting tweaks.
 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.24 to 2.25.

# 2.24.0 (July 28th, 2021)

 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.23 to 2.24.
    - `libpulse-mainloop-glib-sys` from 1.16 to 1.19.

# 2.23.0 (January 30th, 2021)

 * Now using intra-doc-linking introduced in Rust 1.48. The MSRV remains unchanged at 1.41; this is
   too great a simplification to maintaining documentation to not implement immediately; the only
   negative is that links will be broken in locally generated documentation when built with an older
   Rust compiler than version 1.48.
 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.20 to 2.23.

    - Removed the now obsolete `dox` cargo feature.
    - Removed the `pa_latest` and `pa_latest_common` cargo features.
    - Changed the default version feature level to `pa_v8`.
 * MSRV bumped from 1.40 to 1.41.
 * Made use of `#[cfg(doc)]` to always include stuff behind PA version feature guards in generated
   documentation. (Required bump of minimum supported Rust version from 1.40 to 1.41).
 * Added support for feature tagging in documentation (requires nightly Rust version, so only
   enabled if a certain config flag is used, as for the docs.rs copy).
 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.18 to 2.20.

# 2.15.0 (December 29th, 2019)

 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.14 to 2.15.
    - `libpulse-mainloop-glib-sys` from 1.11 to 1.12.

 * Fixed broken doc.rs documentation generation.

# 2.11.0 (August 19th, 2019)

 * Extended support to even older versions of PA, specifically up to and including v4.
 * Simplified feature flags, old ones left as temorary aliases, to be removed later.
 * Added a `dox` feature flag, for use with `cargo doc`.
   It enables the very latest PA version compatibility, while bypassing the pkg-config check, thus
   is useful for generating documentation that includes information on features from versions of PA
   that may be newer than the version you have installed.
 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-binding`           from 2.10 to 2.11.

    - Replaced our own `GMainContext` type (re-exported from our `sys` crate) with the one from the
      `glib-sys` crate.
    - Deprecated use of `GMainContext` directly from this crate.
