//! Audio streams for input, output and sample upload.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Audio streams form the central functionality of the sound server. Data is routed, converted and
//! mixed from several sources before it is passed along to a final output. Currently, there are
//! three forms of audio streams:
//!
//! * Playback streams: Data flows from the client to the server.
//! * Record streams: Data flows from the server to the client.
//! * Upload streams: Similar to playback streams, but the data is stored in the sample cache. See
//!   [`context::scache`] for more information about controlling the sample cache.
//!
//! # Creating
//!
//! To access a stream, a [`Stream`] object must be created using [`Stream::new()`] or
//! [`Stream::new_extended()`]. `new` is for PCM streams only, while `new_extended` can be used for
//! both PCM and compressed audio streams. At this point the application must specify what stream
//! format(s) it supports. See [`sample`] and [`channelmap`] for more information on the stream
//! format parameters.
//!
//! **FIXME**: Those references only talk about PCM parameters, we should also have an overview
//! page for how the [`Info`] based stream format configuration works.
//! [Bug filed](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72265).
//!
//! This first step will only create a client-side object, representing the stream. To use the
//! stream, a server-side object must be created and associated with the local object. Depending on
//! which type of stream is desired, a different function is needed:
//!
//! * Playback stream: [`Stream::connect_playback()`]
//! * Record stream: [`Stream::connect_record()`]
//! * Upload stream: [`Stream::connect_upload()`] \(see [`context::scache`])
//!
//! Similar to how connections are done in contexts, connecting a stream will not generate an
//! [`Operation`] object. Also like contexts, the application should register a state change
//! callback, using [`Stream::set_state_callback()`], and wait for the stream to enter an active
//! state.
//!
//! Note: there is a user-controllable slider in mixer applications such as pavucontrol
//! corresponding to each of the created streams. Multiple (especially identically named) volume
//! sliders for the same application might confuse the user. Also, the server supports only a
//! limited number of simultaneous streams. Because of this, it is not always appropriate to create
//! multiple streams in one application that needs to output multiple sounds. The rough guideline
//! is: if there is no use case that would require separate user-initiated volume changes for each
//! stream, perform the mixing inside the application.
//!
//! # Buffer Attributes
//!
//! Playback and record streams always have a server-side buffer as part of the data flow. The size
//! of this buffer needs to be chosen in a compromise between low latency and sensitivity for buffer
//! overflows/underruns.
//!
//! The buffer metrics may be controlled by the application. They are described with a
//! [`BufferAttr`] structure.
//!
//! If [`FlagSet::ADJUST_LATENCY`] is set, then the `tlength`/`fragsize` parameters of this
//! structure will be interpreted slightly differently than otherwise when passed to
//! [`Stream::connect_record()`] and [`Stream::connect_playback()`]: the overall latency that is
//! comprised of both the server side playback buffer length, the hardware playback buffer length
//! and additional latencies will be adjusted in a way that it matches `tlength` resp. `fragsize`.
//! Set [`FlagSet::ADJUST_LATENCY`] if you want to control the overall playback latency for your
//! stream. Unset it if you want to control only the latency induced by the server-side, rewritable
//! playback buffer. The server will try to fulfill the client’s latency requests as good as
//! possible. However if the underlying hardware cannot change the hardware buffer length or only in
//! a limited range, the actually resulting latency might be different from what the client
//! requested. Thus, for synchronization clients always need to check the actual measured latency
//! via [`Stream::get_latency()`] or a similar call, and not make any assumptions about the latency
//! available. The function [`Stream::get_buffer_attr()`] will always return the actual size of the
//! server-side per-stream buffer in `tlength`/`fragsize`, regardless whether
//! [`FlagSet::ADJUST_LATENCY`] is set or not.
//!
//! The server-side per-stream playback buffers are indexed by a write and a read index. The
//! application writes to the write index and the sound device reads from the read index. The read
//! index is increased monotonically, while the write index may be freely controlled by the
//! application. Subtracting the read index from the write index will give you the current fill
//! level of the buffer. The read/write indexes are 64bit values and measured in bytes, they will
//! never wrap. The current read/write index may be queried using [`Stream::get_timing_info()`]
//! \(see below for more information). In case of a buffer underrun the read index is equal or
//! larger than the write index. Unless the `prebuf` value is `0`, PulseAudio will temporarily pause
//! playback in such a case, and wait until the buffer is filled up to `prebuf` bytes again. If
//! `prebuf` is `0`, the read index may be larger than the write index, in which case silence is
//! played. If the application writes data to indexes lower than the read index, the data is
//! immediately lost.
//!
//! # Transferring Data
//!
//! Once the stream is up, data can start flowing between the client and the server. Two different
//! access models can be used to transfer the data:
//!
//! * Asynchronous: The application registers a callback using [`Stream::set_write_callback()`] and
//!   [`Stream::set_read_callback()`] to receive notifications that data can either be written or
//!   read.
//! * Polled: Query the library for available data/space using [`Stream::writable_size()`] and
//!   [`Stream::readable_size()`] and transfer data as needed. The sizes are stored locally, in the
//!   client end, so there is no delay when reading them.
//!
//! It is also possible to mix the two models freely.
//!
//! Once there is data/space available, it can be transferred using either [`Stream::write()`] for
//! playback, or [`Stream::peek()`] / [`Stream::discard()`] for record. Make sure you do not
//! overflow the playback buffers as data will be dropped.
//!
//! # Buffer Control
//!
//! The transfer buffers can be controlled through a number of operations:
//!
//! * [`Stream::cork()`]: Stop the playback or recording.
//! * [`Stream::uncork()`]: Start the playback or recording.
//! * [`Stream::trigger()`]: Start playback immediately and do not wait for the buffer to fill up to
//!   the set trigger level.
//! * [`Stream::prebuf()`]: Re-enable the playback trigger level.
//! * [`Stream::drain()`]: Wait for the playback buffer to go empty. Will return an [`Operation`]
//!   object that will indicate when the buffer is completely drained.
//! * [`Stream::flush()`]: Drop all data from the playback or record buffer. Do not wait for it to
//!   finish playing.
//!
//! # Seeking in the Playback Buffer
//!
//! A client application may freely seek in the playback buffer. To accomplish that the
//! [`Stream::write()`] function takes a seek mode and an offset argument. The seek mode is one of:
//!
//! * [`SeekMode::Relative`]: seek relative to the current write index.
//! * [`SeekMode::Absolute`]: seek relative to the beginning of the playback buffer, (i.e. the first
//!   that was ever played in the stream).
//! * [`SeekMode::RelativeOnRead`]: seek relative to the current read index. Use this to write data
//!   to the output buffer that should be played as soon as possible.
//! * [`SeekMode::RelativeEnd`]: seek relative to the last byte ever written.
//!
//! If an application just wants to append some data to the output buffer, [`SeekMode::Relative`]
//! and an offset of `0` should be used.
//!
//! After a call to [`Stream::write()`] the write index will be left at the position right after the
//! last byte of the written data.
//!
//! # Latency
//!
//! A major problem with networked audio is the increased latency caused by the network. To remedy
//! this, PulseAudio supports an advanced system of monitoring the current latency.
//!
//! To get the raw data needed to calculate latencies, call [`Stream::get_timing_info()`]. This will
//! give you a [`TimingInfo`] structure that contains everything that is known about the server side
//! buffer transport delays and the backend active in the server. (Besides other things it contains
//! the write and read index values mentioned above.)
//!
//! This structure is updated every time a [`Stream::update_timing_info()`] operation is executed.
//! (i.e. before the first call to this function the timing information structure is not available!)
//! Since it is a lot of work to keep this structure up-to-date manually, PulseAudio can do that
//! automatically for you: if [`FlagSet::AUTO_TIMING_UPDATE`] is passed when connecting the stream
//! PulseAudio will automatically update the structure every 100ms and every time a function is
//! called that might invalidate the previously known timing data (such as [`Stream::write()`] or
//! [`Stream::flush()`]). Please note however, that there always is a short time window when the
//! data in the timing information structure is out-of-date. PulseAudio tries to mark these
//! situations by setting the `write_index_corrupt` and `read_index_corrupt` fields accordingly.
//!
//! The raw timing data in the [`TimingInfo`] structure is usually hard to deal with. Therefore a
//! simpler interface is available: you can call [`Stream::get_time()`] or
//! [`Stream::get_latency()`]. The former will return the current playback time of the hardware
//! since the stream has been started. The latter returns the overall time a sample that you write
//! now takes to be played by the hardware. These two functions base their calculations on the same
//! data that is returned by [`Stream::get_timing_info()`]. Hence the same rules for keeping the
//! timing data up-to-date apply here. In case the write or read index is corrupted, these two
//! functions will fail.
//!
//! Since updating the timing info structure usually requires a full network round trip and some
//! applications monitor the timing very often PulseAudio offers a timing interpolation system. If
//! [`FlagSet::INTERPOLATE_TIMING`] is passed when connecting the stream, [`Stream::get_time()`] and
//! [`Stream::get_latency()`] will try to interpolate the current playback time/latency by
//! estimating the number of samples that have been played back by the hardware since the last
//! regular timing update. It is especially useful to combine this option with
//! [`FlagSet::AUTO_TIMING_UPDATE`], which will enable you to monitor the current playback
//! time/latency very precisely and very frequently without requiring a network round trip every
//! time.
//!
//! # Overflow and underflow
//!
//! Even with the best precautions, buffers will sometime over - or underflow. To handle this
//! gracefully, the application can be notified when this happens. Callbacks are registered using
//! [`Stream::set_overflow_callback()`] and [`Stream::set_underflow_callback()`].
//!
//! # Synchronizing Multiple Playback Streams
//!
//! PulseAudio allows applications to fully synchronize multiple playback streams that are connected
//! to the same output device. That means the streams will always be played back sample-by-sample
//! synchronously. If stream operations like [`Stream::cork()`] are issued on one of the
//! synchronized streams, they are simultaneously issued on the others.
//!
//! To synchronize a stream to another, just pass the “master” stream as the last argument to
//! [`Stream::connect_playback()`]. To make sure that the freshly created stream doesn’t start
//! playback right-away, make sure to pass [`FlagSet::START_CORKED`] and, after all streams have
//! been created, uncork them all with a single call to [`Stream::uncork()`] for the master stream.
//!
//! To make sure that a particular stream doesn’t stop to play when a server side buffer underrun
//! happens on it while the other synchronized streams continue playing and hence deviate, you need
//! to pass a [`BufferAttr`] with `prebuf` set to `0` when connecting.
//!
//! # Disconnecting
//!
//! When a stream has served is purpose it must be disconnected with [`Stream::disconnect()`]. If
//! you only unreference it, then it will live on and eat resources both locally and on the server
//! until you disconnect the context. This is done automatically upon drop of the stream object.
