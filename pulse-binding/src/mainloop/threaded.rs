//! A variation of the standard main loop implementation, using a background thread.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The threaded main loop implementation is a special version of the standard main loop
//! implementation. For the basic design, see the standard main loop documentation
//! ([`mainloop::standard`]).
//!
//! The added feature in the threaded main loop is that it spawns a new thread that runs the real
//! main loop in the background. This allows a synchronous application to use the asynchronous API
//! without risking stalling the PulseAudio library. A few synchronization primitives are available
//! to access the objects attached to the event loop safely.
//!
//! # Creation
//!
//! A [`Mainloop`] object is created using [`Mainloop::new`]. This will only allocate the required
//! structures though, so to use it the thread must also be started. This is done through
//! [`Mainloop::start`], after which you can start using the main loop.
//!
//! # Destruction
//!
//! When the PulseAudio connection has been terminated, the thread must be stopped and the
//! resources freed. Stopping the thread is done using [`Mainloop::stop`], which must be called
//! without the lock (see below) held. When that function returns, the thread is stopped and the
//! [`Mainloop`] object can be destroyed.
//!
//! Destruction of the [`Mainloop`] object is done automatically when the object falls out of scope.
//! (Rust’s `Drop` trait has been implemented and takes care of it).
//!
//! # Locking
//!
//! Since the PulseAudio API doesn’t allow concurrent accesses to objects, a locking scheme must be
//! used to guarantee safe usage. The threaded main loop API provides such a scheme through the
//! functions [`Mainloop::lock`] and [`Mainloop::unlock`].
//!
//! The lock is recursive, so it’s safe to use it multiple times from the same thread. Just make
//! sure you call [`Mainloop::unlock`] the same number of times you called [`Mainloop::lock`].
//!
//! The lock needs to be held whenever you call any PulseAudio function that uses an object
//! associated with this main loop. Make sure you do not hold on to the lock more than necessary
//! though, as the threaded main loop stops while the lock is held.
//!
//! Example:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! extern crate libpulse_binding as pulse;
//!
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! use pulse::mainloop::threaded::Mainloop;
//! use pulse::stream:{Stream, State};
//!
//! fn check_stream(m: Rc<RefCell<Mainloop>>, s: Rc<RefCell<Stream>>) {
//!     m.borrow_mut().lock();
//!
//!     let state = s.borrow().get_state();
//!
//!     m.borrow_mut().unlock();
//!
//!     match state {
//!         State::Ready => { printf!("Stream is ready!"); },
//!         _ => { printf!("Stream is not ready!"); },
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Callbacks
//!
//! Callbacks in PulseAudio are asynchronous, so they require extra care when using them together
//! with a threaded main loop.
//!
//! The easiest way to turn the callback based operations into synchronous ones, is to simply wait
//! for the callback to be called and continue from there. This is the approach chosen in
//! PulseAudio’s threaded API.
//!
//! ## Basic callbacks
//!
//! For the basic case, where all that is required is to wait for the callback to be invoked, the
//! code should look something like this:
//!
//! Example:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! extern crate libpulse_binding as pulse;
//!
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! use pulse::mainloop::threaded::Mainloop;
//! use pulse::operation::State;
//! use pulse::stream:Stream;
//!
//! fn drain_stream(m: Rc<RefCell<Mainloop>>, s: Rc<RefCell<Stream>>) {
//!     m.borrow_mut().lock();
//!
//!     // Drain
//!     let o = {
//!         let ml_ref = Rc::clone(&m);
//!         s.borrow_mut().drain(Some(Box::new(move |_success: bool| {
//!             unsafe { (*ml_ref.as_ptr()).signal(false); }
//!         })))
//!     };
//!     while o.get_state() != pulse::operation::State::Done {
//!         m.borrow_mut().wait();
//!     }
//!
//!     m.borrow_mut().unlock();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The function `drain_stream` will wait for the callback to be called using [`Mainloop::wait`].
//!
//! If your application is multi-threaded, then this waiting must be done inside a while loop. The
//! reason for this is that multiple threads might be using [`Mainloop::wait`] at the same time.
//! Each thread must therefore verify that it was its callback that was invoked. Also the underlying
//! OS synchronization primitives are usually not free of spurious wake-ups, so a [`Mainloop::wait`]
//! must be called within a loop even if you have only one thread waiting.
//!
//! The callback `my_drain_callback` indicates to the main function that it has been called using
//! [`Mainloop::signal`].
//!
//! As you can see, [`Mainloop::wait`] may only be called with the lock held. The same thing is true
//! for [`Mainloop::signal`], but as the lock is held before the callback is invoked, you do not
//! have to deal with that.
//!
//! The functions will not dead lock because the wait function will release the lock before waiting
//! and then regrab it once it has been signalled. For those of you familiar with threads, the
//! behaviour is that of a condition variable.
//!
//! ## Data callbacks
//!
//! For many callbacks, simply knowing that they have been called is insufficient. The callback also
//! receives some data that is desired. To access this data safely, we must extend our example a
//! bit:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! extern crate libpulse_binding as pulse;
//!
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! use pulse::mainloop::threaded::Mainloop;
//! use pulse::stream:Stream;
//!
//! struct DrainCbData(Option<&mut bool>);
//!
//! fn drain_stream(m: Rc<RefCell<Mainloop>>, s: Rc<RefCell<Stream>>) {
//!     m.borrow_mut().lock();
//!
//!     let mut data = DrainCbData(None);
//!
//!     // Drain
//!     let o = {
//!         let ml_ref = Rc::clone(&m);
//!         s.borrow_mut().drain(Some(Box::new(move |success: bool| {
//!             data.0 = Some(&mut success);
//!             unsafe { (*ml_ref.as_ptr()).signal(true); }
//!         })))
//!     };
//!     while o.get_state() != pulse::operation::State::Done {
//!         m.borrow_mut().wait();
//!     }
//!
//!     assert!(!data.0.is_none());
//!     let success = *(data.0.take());
//!     m.borrow_mut().accept(); // Allow callback to continue now
//!
//!     match success {
//!         0 => { println!("Bitter defeat..."); },
//!         _ => { println!("Success!"); },
//!     }
//!
//!     m.borrow_mut().unlock();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The example is a bit silly as it would have been more simple to just copy the contents of
//! `success`, but for larger data structures this can be wasteful.
//!
//! The difference here compared to the basic callback is the value `true` passed to
//! [`Mainloop::signal`] and the call to [`Mainloop::accept`]. What will happen is that
//! [`Mainloop::signal`] will signal the main function and then wait. The main function is then free
//! to use the data in the callback until [`Mainloop::accept`] is called, which will allow the
//! callback to continue.
//!
//! Note that [`Mainloop::accept`] must be called some time between exiting the while loop and
//! unlocking the main loop! Failure to do so will result in a race condition. I.e. it is not okay
//! to release the lock and regrab it before calling [`Mainloop::accept`].
//!
//! ## Asynchronous callbacks
//!
//! PulseAudio also has callbacks that are completely asynchronous, meaning that they can be called
//! at any time. The threaded main loop API provides the locking mechanism to handle concurrent
//! accesses, but nothing else. Applications will have to handle communication from the callback to
//! the main program through their own mechanisms.
//!
//! The callbacks that are completely asynchronous are:
//!
//! * State callbacks for contexts, streams, etc.
//! * Subscription notifications.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! An example program using the threaded mainloop:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate libpulse_binding as pulse;
//!
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! use std::ops::Deref;
//! use pulse::mainloop::threaded::Mainloop;
//! use pulse::context::Context;
//! use pulse::stream::Stream;
//! use pulse::proplist::Proplist;
//! use pulse::mainloop::api::Mainloop as MainloopTrait; //Needs to be in scope
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let spec = pulse::sample::Spec {
//!         format: pulse::sample::SAMPLE_S16NE,
//!         channels: 2,
//!         rate: 44100,
//!     };
//!     assert!(spec.is_valid());
//!
//!     let mut proplist = Proplist::new().unwrap();
//!     proplist.set_str(pulse::proplist::properties::APPLICATION_NAME, "FooApp")
//!         .unwrap();
//!
//!     let mut mainloop = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Mainloop::new()
//!         .expect("Failed to create mainloop")));
//!
//!     let mut context = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Context::new_with_proplist(
