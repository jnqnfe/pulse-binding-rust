//! Routines for daemon introspection.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Sometimes it is necessary to query and modify global settings in the server. For this,
//! PulseAudio has the introspection API. It can list sinks, sources, samples and other aspects of
//! the server. It can also modify the attributes of the server that will affect operations on a
//! global level, and not just the application’s context.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The introspection routines are exposed as methods on an [`Introspector`] object held by the
//! [`Context`] object, and can be accessed via the [`Context::introspect()`] method.
//!
//! # Querying
//!
//! All querying is done through callbacks. This approach is necessary to maintain an asynchronous
//! design. The client will request the information and some time later, the server will respond
//! with the desired data.
//!
//! Some objects can have multiple instances on the server. When requesting all of these at once,
//! the callback will be called multiple times, each time with an [`ListResult`] variant. It will be
//! called once for each item in turn, using the `Item` variant, and then once more time with the
//! `End` variant to signal that the end of the list has been reached. If an error occurs, then
//! the `Error` variant will be given.
//!
//! Note that even if a single object is requested, and not the entire list, the terminating call
//! will still be made.
//!
//! Data members in the information structures are only valid during the duration of the callback.
//! If they are required after the callback is finished, a deep copy of the information structure
//! must be performed.
//!
//! # Server Information
//!
//! The server can be queried about its name, the environment it’s running on and the currently
//! active global defaults. Calling [`Introspector::get_server_info()`] provides access to a
//! [`ServerInfo`] structure containing all of these.
//!
//! # Memory Usage
//!
//! Statistics about memory usage can be fetched using [`Introspector::stat()`], giving a
//! [`StatInfo`] structure.
//!
//! # Sinks and Sources
//!
//! The server can have an arbitrary number of sinks and sources. Each sink and source have both an
//! index and a name associated with it. As such, there are three ways to get access to them:
//!
//! * By index: [`Introspector::get_sink_info_by_index()`],
//!             [`Introspector::get_source_info_by_index()`]
//! * By name:  [`Introspector::get_sink_info_by_name()`],
//!             [`Introspector::get_source_info_by_name()`]
//! * All:      [`Introspector::get_sink_info_list()`],
//!             [`Introspector::get_source_info_list()`]
//!
//! All three methods use the same callback and will provide a [`SinkInfo`] or [`SourceInfo`]
//! structure.
//!
//! # Sink Inputs and Source Outputs
//!
//! Sink inputs and source outputs are the representations of the client ends of streams inside the
//! server. I.e. they connect a client stream to one of the global sinks or sources.
//!
//! Sink inputs and source outputs only have an index to identify them. As such, there are only two
//! ways to get information about them:
//!
//! * By index: [`Introspector::get_sink_input_info()`],
//!             [`Introspector::get_source_output_info()`]
//! * All:      [`Introspector::get_sink_input_info_list()`],
//!             [`Introspector::get_source_output_info_list()`]
//!
//! The structure returned is the [`SinkInputInfo`] or [`SourceOutputInfo`] structure.
//!
//! # Samples
//!
//! The list of cached samples can be retrieved from the server. Three methods exist for querying
//! the sample cache list:
//!
//! * By index: [`Introspector::get_sample_info_by_index()`]
//! * By name:  [`Introspector::get_sample_info_by_name()`]
//! * All:      [`Introspector::get_sample_info_list()`]
//!
//! Note that this only retrieves information about the sample, not the sample data itself.
//!
//! # Driver Modules
//!
//! PulseAudio driver modules are identified by index and are retrieved using either
//! [`Introspector::get_module_info()`] or [`Introspector::get_module_info_list()`]. The information
//! structure is called [`ModuleInfo`].
//!
//! # Clients
//!
//! PulseAudio clients are also identified by index and are retrieved using either
//! [`Introspector::get_client_info()`] or [`Introspector::get_client_info_list()`]. The information
//! structure is called [`ClientInfo`].
//!
//! # Control
//!
//! Some parts of the server are only possible to read, but most can also be modified in different
//! ways. Note that these changes will affect all connected clients and not just the one issuing the
//! request.
//!
//! # Sinks and Sources
//!
//! The most common change one would want to apply to sinks and sources is to modify the volume of
//! the audio. Identically to how sinks and sources can be queried, there are two ways of
//! identifying them:
//!
//! * By index: [`Introspector::set_sink_volume_by_index()`],
//!             [`Introspector::set_source_volume_by_index()`]
//! * By name:  [`Introspector::set_sink_volume_by_name()`],
//!             [`Introspector::set_source_volume_by_name()`]
//!
//! It is also possible to mute a sink or source:
//!
//! * By index: [`Introspector::set_sink_mute_by_index()`],
//!             [`Introspector::set_source_mute_by_index()`]
//! * By name:  [`Introspector::set_sink_mute_by_name()`],
//!             [`Introspector::set_source_mute_by_name()`]
//!
//! # Sink Inputs and Source Outputs
//!
//! If an application desires to modify the volume of just a single stream (commonly one of its own
//! streams), this can be done by setting the volume of its associated sink input or source output,
//! using [`Introspector::set_sink_input_volume()`] or [`Introspector::set_source_output_volume()`].
//!
//! It is also possible to remove sink inputs and source outputs, terminating the streams associated
//! with them:
//!
//! * Sink input: [`Introspector::kill_sink_input()`]
//! * Source output: [`Introspector::kill_source_output()`]
//!
//! It is strongly recommended that all volume changes are done as a direct result of user input.
//! With automated requests, such as those resulting from misguided attempts of crossfading,
//! PulseAudio can store the stream volume at an inappropriate moment and restore it later. Besides,
//! such attempts lead to OSD popups in some desktop environments.
//!
//! As a special case of the general rule above, it is recommended that your application leaves the
//! task of saving and restoring the volume of its streams to PulseAudio and does not attempt to do
//! it by itself. PulseAudio really knows better about events such as stream moving or headphone
//! plugging that would make the volume stored by the application inapplicable to the new
//! configuration.
//!
//! Another important case where setting a sink input volume may be a bad idea is related to
//! interpreters that interpret potentially untrusted scripts. PulseAudio relies on your application
//! not making malicious requests (such as repeatedly setting the volume to 100%). Thus, script
//! interpreters that represent a security boundary must sandbox volume-changing requests coming
//! from their scripts. In the worst case, it may be necessary to apply the script-requested volume
//! to the script-produced sounds by altering the samples in the script interpreter and not touching
//! the sink or sink input volume as seen by PulseAudio.
//!
//! If an application changes any volume, it should also listen to changes of the same volume
//! originating from outside the application (e.g., from the system mixer application) and update
//! its user interface accordingly. Use [`Context::subscribe()`] to get such notifications.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! Server modules can be remotely loaded and unloaded using [`Introspector::load_module()`] and
//! [`Introspector::unload_module()`].
//!
//! # Clients
//!
//! The only operation supported on clients is the possibility of kicking them off the server using
//! [`Introspector::kill_client()`].
