 * Simplified feature flags, old ones left as temorary aliases, to be removed later.
 * Added a `dox` feature flag, for use with `cargo doc`.
   It enables the very latest PA version compatibility, while bypassing the pkg-config check, thus
   is useful for generating documentation that includes information on features from versions of PA
   that may be newer than the version you have installed.

# 1.6.0 (August 12th, 2019)

   Rust nomicon ([here][nomicon-ros]) the use of the empty enum trick is apparently undefined
   behaviour.

   `latest_pa_compatibility`.

 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-sys` from 1.4 to 1.5.

# 1.4.0 (November 4th, 2018)

   for those without the necessary *.pc files installed). Thanks to @JohnAZoidberg on github for
   the original patch.

 * Updated required dependencies:
    - `libpulse-sys` from 1.3 to 1.4.
